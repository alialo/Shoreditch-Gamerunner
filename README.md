=====================

This is the server runner for the Shoreditch AI competition. It should be used during development of competitors to test them and will be used to run the final competition.

To automatically register an AI with the gamerunner (especially useful during testing) you must place the AI in a directory in the "ai" directory. Any AIs in this directory will be available to play against each other using the admin interface. Included by default is the SampleAI.
